# 🚦 Smart Traffic Light System: Optimizing Urban Traffic with Real-Time Vehicle Detection 🚗  

Traffic congestion is a growing challenge in cities, leading to delays, increased emissions, and frustration. I’m thrilled to present my latest project: a **Smart Traffic Light System** that addresses these issues by adjusting signal timings based on real-time vehicle density!  

## 🔧 Key Features:  
- Detects vehicles at all junctions (north, south, east, west) using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
- Dynamically adjusts signals to reduce congestion.  
- Optimizes traffic flow and minimizes idle time, helping save fuel and reduce emissions.  

This project was a great learning experience in implementing technology for real-world challenges. A big thanks to **[mention anyone who helped]!**  

I’d love to hear your feedback on this project. Let’s connect and discuss ideas for **smart city innovations**! 🌐
